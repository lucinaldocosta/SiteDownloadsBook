Adventure Genre Definition – what’s the best definition for the
        adventure fiction genre? The adventure genre consists of books where the
        protagonist goes on an epic journey, either personally or
        geographically. Often the protagonist has a mission and faces many
        obstacles in his way. A good example would be The Lord of the Rings
        series. The adventure genre often pairs up with the action genre, since
        long epic journeys have a lot of action in them.

A biography is simply the story of a real person’s life. It could be
        about a person who is still alive, someone who lived centuries ago,
        someone who is globally famous, an unsung hero forgotten by history, or
        even a unique group of people. The facts of their life, from birth to
        death (or the present day of the author), are included with
        life-changing moments often taking center stage. The author usually
        points to the subject’s childhood, coming-of-age events, relationships,
        failures, and successes in order to create a well-rounded description of
        her subject.

A fictional book is a text created specifically for a work in an
        imaginary narrative that is referred to, depicted, or excerpted in a
        story, book, film, or other fictional work, and which exists only in one
        or more fictional works. A fictional book may be created to add realism
        or depth to a larger fictional work. A fictional book may provide the
        basis of the plot of a story, a common thread in a series of books or
        other works, or the works of a particular writer or canon of work.
